The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street
What could he have been thinking of
It must have been a trick of the light
He supposed this was some stupid new fashion
They were whispering excitedly together
Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime
He yelled at five different people
He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more
He eyed them angrily as he passed
He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry
It might have been Harvey
He had been hugged by a complete stranger
It was now sitting on his garden wall
It just gave him a stern look
Was this normal cat behavior
He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife
Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place
He cleared his throat nervously
It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something
Could all this have anything to do with the Potters
The Dursleys got into bed
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter
The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun
She looked distinctly ruffled
When you could have been celebrating
They were bound to notice something
He went to find the Potters
Professor McGonagall gasped
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it
These people will never understand him
Famous before he can walk and talk
He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide
I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street
He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four
Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up
Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed
His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day
His aunt rapped on the door again
He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having
There had been a flying motorcycle in it
His aunt was back outside the door
Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks
When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon
Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat
Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once
It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families
After lunch they went to the reptile house
Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place
Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes
Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching
The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass
COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE
People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits
Piers and Dudley could only gibber
He was so angry he could hardly speak
There were no photographs of them in the house
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley
Piers Polkiss was going there too
Dudley thought this was very funny
This was supposed to be good training for later life
He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh
The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water
Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question
Harry looked in the bowl again
They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat
His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights
Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge
Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line
For a moment it looked as though she might faint
She clutched her throat and made a choking noise
He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick
It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room
He sat down on the bed and stared around him
Other shelves were full of books
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly
They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall
Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently
He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights
He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea
Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink
Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day
He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again
I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave
By nightfall Dudley was howling
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day
They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table
Great drops beat on the roof of the car
I want to stay somewhere with a television
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea
Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces
There were only two rooms
He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up
He was in a very good mood
Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail
The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on
Harry heard something creak outside
Was the rock crumbling into the sea
CHAPTER FOUR THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS BOOM
There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway
He turned to look at them all
Harry opened it with trembling fingers
Harry looked up at the giant
Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage
In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice
Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror
Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard
Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment
Term begins on September 1
We await your owl by no later than July 31
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow
Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone
Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly
It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years
He looked suddenly anxious
Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead
Hagrid was watching him sadly
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage
He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched
Same night he tried ter kill you
Makes yeh even more famous
Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die
People who was on his side came back ter ours
But he had finally gone too far
Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard
But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper
He went straight to the window and jerked it open
Then he flew off through the open window
The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight
Deep under the Underground
Bungler if ever there was one
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station
Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket
Harry had never been to London before
This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people
Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them
One of them was smoking a long pipe
The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in
Everyone was looking at him
The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out
One of his eyes was twitching
It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all
The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop
They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry
He bowed as they walked inside
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter
The goblin wrinkled his nose
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals
The goblin looked at it closely
They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches
It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor
Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them
At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages
Inside were mounds of gold coins
Heaps of little bronze Knuts
How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag
The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole
He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away
Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor
Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat
He was liking the boy less and less every second
not sounding sorry at all
I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families
They stopped to buy parchment and quills
You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh
this was what Harry had been really looking forward to
The last shop was narrow and shabby
A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside
Harry wished he would blink
Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes
Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke
Beechwood and dragon heartstring
He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers
Curious indeed how these things happen
He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them
How can they expect great things
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile
He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket
His aunt and uncle stared
He left without another word
Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away
All three of them were laughing
Harry was now trying hard not to panic
There was nothing else for it
He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier
He started to walk toward it
People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten
Harry walked more quickly
A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people
Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat
Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief
Then she turned to the twins
Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner
Houses flashed past the window
Harry felt a great leap of excitement
The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in
Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose
The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them
Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar
Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep
Harry went out into the corridor
Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it
There were four sandwiches inside
Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore
Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling
The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder
It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end
She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes
Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep
She said all this very fast
Gloom seemed to be settling on him again
He was looking at the other boys
Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean
Draco Malfoy looked at him
He looked closer at Scabbers
Harry peered out of the window
He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky
The train did seem to be slowing down
He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes
The train slowed right down and finally stopped
Harry shivered in the cold night air
It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there
Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione
It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood
CHAPTER SEVEN THE SORTING HAT The door swung open at once
They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor
Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards
I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours
Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair
In front of the whole school
Harry tried hard not to listen to her
He kept his eyes fixed on the door
So did the people around him
About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall
Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place
These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets
At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting
The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight
This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty
It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again
Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment
The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table
Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her
He was starting to feel definitely sick now
He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school
The hat took a long time to decide with Neville
Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat
He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table
He could see the High Table properly now
He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban
And now there were only three people left to be sorted
Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away
Harry looked down at his empty gold plate
He had only just realized how hungry he was
The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago
Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet
And here they are: Nitwit
Everybody clapped and cheered
The dishes in front of him were now piled with food
Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat
His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge
Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning
Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row
A moment later the desserts appeared
Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet
Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore
It happened very suddenly
Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch
Everybody finished the song at different times
Their trunks had already been brought up
It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open
Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning
She patrolled the corridors alone
Professor McGonagall was again different
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron
Harry tore it open at once
I want to hear all about your first week
Send us an answer back with Hedwig
Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons
Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class
They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels
Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons
Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils
A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door
When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks
There was only one room inside
Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day
He grunted and offered him another rock cake
Harry read the story again
The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day
Had that been what the thieves were looking for
Had Hagrid collected that package just in time
Harry and Ron jumped to their feet
She turned to the rest of the class
No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter
Everyone stopped talking to watch
Blood was pounding in his ears
He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair
A few people below were clapping
Professor McGonagall was running toward them
What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep
She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her
Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom
She opened the door and poked her head inside
Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys
He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon
Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage
Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry
He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole
The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower
They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows
They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room
The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them
Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once
Then a noise in the next room made them jump
He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight
The forbidden corridor on the third floor
And now they knew why it was forbidden
But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed
They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel
Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read
Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it
Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day
Held never been inside the stadium before
At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end
The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch
There are seven players on each side
Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops
Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box
He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers
It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings
The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had
They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them
He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view
They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight
The smell coming from it was incredible
The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside
Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside
The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione
Its mean little eyes saw Harry
The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk
It was Hermione who spoke first
It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue
Harry had never seen her look so angry
Harry looked at the floor
He wished Ron would put his wand down
Then a small voice came out of the shadows
Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club
Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron
Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this
They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady
The common room was packed and noisy
Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up
There was a very embarrassed pause
The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel
The Quidditch season had begun
Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping
The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening
Why should he be afraid of Snape
He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked
Perhaps Snape had left the book in there
Snape was holding his robes above his knees
One of his legs was bloody and mangled
Filch was handing Snape bandages
The next morning dawned very bright and cold
Many students had binoculars
Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors
Madam Hooch was refereeing
Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him
Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle
Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch
In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold
He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees
It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off
But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off
Lee was still commentating
The Slytherins were cheering
He stared through his binoculars
Then the whole crowd gasped
Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them
Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry
Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing
It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire
A sudden yelp told her she had done her job
CHAPTER TWELVE THE MIRROR OF ERISED Christmas was coming
No one could wait for the holidays to start
Crabbe and Goyle chuckled
Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match
Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section
Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him
What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks
Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess
Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted
Harry picked up the top parcel
Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute
Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself
Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence
This only left one parcel
Harry picked it up and felt it
Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds
He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely
It is time it was returned to you
A Very Merry Christmas to you
Ron was admiring the cloak
Had it really once belonged to his father
Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight
Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner
Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey
Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice
Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day
Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it
He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself
It was a very funny feeling
The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak
Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence
He walked quickly down the corridor
The Restricted Section in the library
Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books
One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood
He had to start somewhere
A large black and silver volume caught his eye
He backed away as quietly as he could
A door stood ajar to his left
It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in
It looked like an unused classroom
There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi
He stepped in front of it
He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming
He looked in the mirror again
A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving
He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him
She was a very pretty woman
Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection
He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight
He had almost forgotten about Flamel
Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding
Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror
His mother and father beamed at the sight of him
Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry
What if they walk into you
That third night he found his way more quickly than before
Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror
There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family
Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore
He started having nightmares
Wood was working the team harder than ever
He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower
He stared at the back of the card
Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione
At last she found what she was looking for
The stone will transform any metal into pure gold
There was no mistaking that silver beard
Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe
There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching
The evening air had never smelled so sweet
Harry had reached the shed
A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle
Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off
Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run
Harry strained to catch what they were saying
Quirrell was mumbling something
She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes
He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat
He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table
It was stifling hot inside
There was no point beating around the bush
Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione
Harry noticed him glance at the fire
He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire
Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut
Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen
The egg was lying on the table
There were deep cracks in it
The baby dragon flopped onto the table
A couple of sparks flew out of its snout
Even at a distance there was no mistaking him
Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils
There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor
The following week dragged by
The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open
When it bit me he told me off for frightening it
Send me an answer as soon as possible
How dare you tell such lies
Hermione did a sort of jig
The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs
How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak
She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them
That put Gryffindor in last place
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach
How could they ever make up for this
He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours
How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday
He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team
All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery
Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be
Then they heard a distant shout
Malfoy now turned to Hagrid
This is the second time in a week
I found one dead last Wednesday
Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried
There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path
The three of them listened
Students up at the school
He flung back his head and stared at the sky
He had the nasty feeling they were being watched
He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them
Their ears seemed sharper than usual
Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks
Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker
Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad
Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood
It took a minute or two to pass
It will be quicker this way
There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing
You have a human on your back
Bane kicked his back legs in anger
What is that to do with us
Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold
Or have the planets not let you in on that secret
He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake
He paced up and down in front of the fire
There was a note pinned to it: Just in case
They had practical exams as well
Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters
Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore
You know that night you won Norbert
She bent down and gathered up the fallen books
Harry and Ron wheeled round
The other two stared at him
He was pale and his eyes were glittering
Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do
Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory
He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas
He ran back down to the common room
Neville stared at their guilty faces
Hermione ran to turn him over
He narrowed his wicked black eyes
He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs
Harry pushed the door open
He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips
It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant
Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her
what did Professor Sprout say
All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls
A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead
On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door
He reached the door untouched
The other two followed him
The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron
Ron turned to the other two
Ron started to direct the black pieces
They moved silently wherever he sent them
Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall
Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle
He turned to face the black flames
It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE MAN WITH TWO FACES It was Quirrell
So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat
She broke my eye contact with you
Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry
I need to examine this interesting mirror
It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell
He suspected me all along
He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror
Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was
is the Stone inside the mirror
He was still talking to himself
Harry got slowly to his feet
Quirrell moved close behind him
Dare he make a break for it
Then he turned slowly on the spot
The evil face was now smiling
Something gold was glinting just above him
The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him
Harry swallowed and looked around him
He realized he must be in the hospital wing
No doubt they thought it would amuse you
Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you
As much money and life as you could want
Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling
Always use the proper name for things
Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me
I suggest you make a start on these sweets
I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance
I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy
Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it
Harry opened it curiously
It was full of wizard photographs
Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father
A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table
Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table
Dumbledore raised his hand
The room gradually fell silent
He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before
It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform
Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione
